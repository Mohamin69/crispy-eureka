React + Framer Motion demo for HAMZA Beauty

Setup
1. From project root open a terminal and navigate to `react-app`:

```bash
cd react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Development server will start on http://localhost:5173 by default.

Images
- The demo references images at `/images/...`. To use your project images place them in `react-app/public/images` (create that folder) and copy the files from the main `images/` folder, or update the image paths in `src/components/Products.jsx` to point to your preferred locations.

Notes
- This is a lightweight demo to show the site in React with Framer Motion animations. You can progressively migrate server endpoints (PHP) or integrate the contact form with an API endpoint later.
